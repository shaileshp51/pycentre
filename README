This package is developed to convert Cartesian coordinate Molecular Dynamics trajectories generated using 
AMBER/NAMD/CHARMM/GROMACS to BOND-ANGLE-TORSION coordinate trajectory. This package also implements the 
auxilary functions for analysis of convergance of entropy computed using CENTRE. It also implements
functions for contribution analysis.
